<h3 align="left">One of my first projects, a rhythm-game with storyline about four friends trying to win the cup of the best jumper - J.U.M.P.</h3>
I did all the code in the project alone (except thrid party like DOTween or Rhythm-game core asset).

Builded and playable game on itch.io (Android only): <a href="https://night-coffee-studio.itch.io/jump">https://night-coffee-studio.itch.io/jump</a>
